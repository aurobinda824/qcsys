# Quantum Computing System (QCSYS) - Superconducting Qubits Integration

## Introduction

Quantum computing systems like QCSYS require robust and versatile support for different qubit types to cater to diverse computational needs. This project introduces a comprehensive framework to integrate superconducting qubits into QCSYS. The implementation adds support for flux qubits, transmons, and fluxoniums, each modeled with their distinct characteristics using a custom Flux class. The goal is to provide a scalable, realistic, and efficient system for simulating superconducting qubits with precise energy constraints and error resistance.

## Detailed Design and Implementation

### 1. Superconducting Qubit Framework

The foundation of this implementation is the Flux class, derived from FluxDevice. This class encapsulates the physical properties and mathematical models for superconducting qubits, including:

#### a. Hamiltonian Construction

- **Linear Hamiltonian:** Models the basic energy dynamics of qubits.
  - For flux qubits, the Hamiltonian includes phase and charge terms influenced by external flux.
  - For transmons, it uses a simple harmonic oscillator model.
  - For fluxoniums, additional terms reflect their complex phase-dependent behaviors.

- **Nonlinear Hamiltonian:** Captures the periodic potential specific to each qubit type.
  - Flux qubits use a cosine term with Josephson energy (Ej).
  - Transmons utilize a cosine potential without additional scaling.
  - Fluxoniums incorporate multiple periodic terms for more accurate modeling.

#### b. Quantum Operators

The class defines standard quantum operators, which are essential for simulating qubits:

- **Annihilation (a) and creation (a_dag) operators:** Represent qubit energy levels.
- **Phase (phi) and charge (n) operators:** Derived using zero-point fluctuations.
- **Zero-point fluctuations:** Calculated using circuit parameters (El, Ec), ensuring realistic scaling of operators for superconducting circuits.

#### c. Profiling Tools

Profiling is integral to optimizing performance in quantum systems. The implementation uses:

- `@profile_function` decorator: Analyzes function-level execution times.
- `@line_profile_function` decorator: Pinpoints bottlenecks at the line level. These tools provide insights into performance hotspots, enabling targeted optimizations.

### 2. Code Example: Flux Class

Below is a simplified example of the Flux class:

```python
import numpy as np

class Flux:
    def __init__(self, qubit_type, El, Ec, phi_ext=0):
        """
        Initialize the Flux class.

        Args:
            qubit_type (str): Type of the qubit ('flux', 'transmon', or 'fluxonium').
            El (float): Inductive energy of the circuit.
            Ec (float): Capacitive energy of the circuit.
            phi_ext (float): External flux parameter for flux qubits.
        """
        self.qubit_type = qubit_type
        self.El = El
        self.Ec = Ec
        self.phi_ext = phi_ext

    def phi_zpf(self):
        """Calculate zero-point fluctuations for phase."""
        return np.sqrt(self.Ec / self.El)

    def n_zpf(self):
        """Calculate zero-point fluctuations for charge."""
        return np.sqrt(self.El / self.Ec)

    def get_H_linear(self):
        """Construct the linear Hamiltonian based on the qubit type."""
        if self.qubit_type == "flux":
            phi = self.phi_zpf() * self.phi_ext
            n = self.n_zpf()
            return 0.5 * (phi**2 + n**2)
        elif self.qubit_type == "transmon":
            return self.Ec * np.eye(2)  # Placeholder for the linear model
        elif self.qubit_type == "fluxonium":
            return self.El * np.eye(2)  # Placeholder for the fluxonium model
        else:
            raise ValueError("Unsupported qubit type")

    def get_H_nonlinear(self):
        """Construct the nonlinear Hamiltonian based on the qubit type."""
        if self.qubit_type == "flux":
            return -self.El * np.cos(self.phi_ext)
        elif self.qubit_type == "transmon":
            return -self.Ec * np.cos(1)  # Placeholder for transmon model
        elif self.qubit_type == "fluxonium":
            return -self.El * np.cos(2)  # Placeholder for fluxonium model
        else:
            raise ValueError("Unsupported qubit type")
